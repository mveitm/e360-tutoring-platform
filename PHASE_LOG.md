## Continuity notes

* Single shared PostgreSQL DB across environments: handle carefully.
* Some older phase boundaries are reconstructed from code/history rather than fully logged live.
* Canonical decisionType set: `advance`, `reinforce`, `hold`, `redirect`.
* Canonical evaluationType values: `diagnostic`, `progress_check`, `cycle_close`.
* Canonical loadType values: `practice`, `reading`, `video`, `project`, `assessment`.

## Phase CG — Inline confidence editing on enrollment detail
- Added inline confidenceLevel editing on enrollment detail SkillState cards
- Canonical options: none / low / medium / high
- Reused existing PATCH flow for skill states
- Corrected local confidenceLevel typing from number to string in enrollment-detail-view
- Verified with tsc, build, manual UI test, persistence check, and post-deploy confirmation
- Deployed to tutoring-platform-mv-l4o1ne.abacusai.app
- Post-deploy issues: none

## Phase CH — Inline reinforcement editing on enrollment detail
- Added inline needsReinforcement editing on enrollment detail SkillState cards
- Canonical options: No reinforce / Reinforce ⚠
- Reused existing PATCH flow for skill states with boolean mapping
- Replaced the old conditional amber "Needs reinforcement" label with an inline select
- Verified with tsc, build, manual UI toggle test, persistence check, sync check, and post-deploy confirmation
- Deployed to tutoring-platform-mv-l4o1ne.abacusai.app
- Post-deploy issues: none

Note:
- Abacus post-deploy summary mentioned prior Phase CE as part of the shipped checkpoint narrative.
- No functional issue observed, but future post-deploy summaries should describe only the phase being deployed to avoid custody ambiguity.

## Phase CJ-pre — Guarded legacy fallback for StudyLoad loadType
- Added guarded compatibility fallback for non-canonical StudyLoad.loadType values in read/edit selects
- Legacy values now render truthfully as `<raw value> (legacy)` instead of collapsing to the first canonical option
- Applied only to existing persisted-value selects in:
  - study-loads-view
  - cycle-detail-view
- Create paths remain restricted to canonical options
- Verified with tsc, build, manual UI checks, and post-deploy confirmation
- Deployed to tutoring-platform-mv-l4o1ne.abacusai.app
- Post-deploy issues: none

## Phase CJ — Study Loads search in cycle detail
- Added client-side search/filter for Study Loads in cycle detail view
- Search matches by study load title and loadType
- Added empty state and "Showing X of Y" indicator
- Search is hidden when the cycle has no study loads
- Verified with tsc, build, manual UI checks, and post-deploy confirmation
- Deployed together with CJ-pre to tutoring-platform-mv-l4o1ne.abacusai.app
- Post-deploy issues: none

## Phase CK — Cycle Decisions search in cycle detail
- Added client-side search/filter for Cycle Decisions in cycle detail view
- Search matches by decisionType and rationale
- Added empty state and "Showing X of Y" indicator

- Verified with tsc, build, authenticated post-deploy bundle check, and regression check against Study Loads search
- Deployed to tutoring-platform-mv-l4o1ne.abacusai.app
- Post-deploy issues: none

## Phase CL — Cycle Evaluations search in cycle detail
- Added client-side search/filter for Cycle Evaluations in cycle detail view
- Search matches by evaluationType and resultSummary
- Added empty state and "Showing X of Y" indicator
- Search renders only when the cycle has evaluations
- Verified with tsc, build, authenticated post-deploy bundle check, and regression checks against Study Loads and Cycle Decisions search
- Deployed to tutoring-platform-mv-l4o1ne.abacusai.app
- Post-deploy issues: none

  - video
  - project
  - assessment
- Non-canonical values now return HTTP 400 with a stable error message
- PUT requests that omit loadType remain unaffected
- GET, PATCH, and DELETE handlers remain unchanged

  - diagnostic
  - progress_check
  - cycle_close
- Non-canonical values now return HTTP 400 with a stable error message
- PUT requests that omit evaluationType remain unaffected
- Verified with tsc, build, authenticated local curl matrix, and live deployment confirmation
- Deployed to tutoring-platform-mv-l4o1ne.abacusai.app
- Post-deploy issues: none

## Phase CP — Empty-search-result state for Learning Cycles list
- Added an empty-search-result state to the Learning Cycles list view
- When a non-empty query matches zero rows, the UI now shows:
  - Search icon
  - "No learning cycles match your search." message
- Existing "Showing X of Y" behavior remains intact
- Empty search still shows the full list unchanged
- Verified with tsc, build, browser checks, and live deployment confirmation
- Deployed to tutoring-platform-mv-l4o1ne.abacusai.app
- Post-deploy issues: none

## Phase CQ — Empty-search-result state for Students list
- Added an empty-search-result state to the Students list view
